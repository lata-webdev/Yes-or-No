# 💍 Will You Marry Me?  Fun Interactive Project

This is a playful and creative web project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where the user is asked a fun proposal question:  
**"Will You Marry Me?"**  with two buttons: **Yes** and **No**.

But here's the twist:  
When the user clicks **"No"**, they are taken to another page with the same question again.  
This loop continues through multiple pages  and eventually, only the **"Yes"** button is available!  
So no matter how many times you try to say **No**, you’ll end up saying **Yes** 😄
